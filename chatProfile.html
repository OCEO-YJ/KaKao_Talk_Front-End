          Since I was young I disassembled and assembled anything to make what I imagined
          whenever I came up with some creative ideas.
          The more I invented something, I became more fascinated with
          its beauty and the possibility of making a better world.

        One day, I came across a book called 'Software Developer' by chance!
        After I read a few pages, I was just fascinated with it only because
        "I could create whatever I imagine with just a laptop."
        This book resolved all the problems of hardships that I felt limitation
        to prepare resources to actualize what I imagined.
        Even though I did not understand the book at first,
        I felt that "this is what I really want to do," and so
        I firmly decided to be a Software Developer.

        Since I bought the book, I kept copying and pasting other developers' codes
        to be a friend with programming. The more I analyzed other developers' codes,
        the more I was addicted to programming because I could learn and get ideas
        from other developers' algorithms, techniques, and ideas.

        Honestly, before I learned programming by myself,
        I thought my idea was the best because I was just a big fish in a little pond.
        However, I was totally wrong. I realized that there was an infinite
        amount of valuable ideas that I had never thought about and
        I felt that why programming is infinite and beautiful.

        I think creativity does not just simply mean innovation,
        but it is the harmony of varying thoughts from people.
        Every person has grown up with different experiences, cultures, and backgrounds.
        If more diverse people collaborate, we cannot even imagine how powerful our creativity would be.
        I would gladly dedicate my passion and career to an internship.
